Easiest way to do this is the brute force method which is run a loop in a loop to check for the sum is equal to the target. However, this solution is a O of n squared solution, but the question asks us to look for a better solution than O of n square. So, the next approach would be to use a hash map or a dictionary.

When we find such an element, we return the index of the element and its complement. We are using a hash map because the lookup of a hash map function is constant time.

Let's dive into the understanding of your solution.\\n\\n**Question 1:**  \\nYou've mentioned that the time complexity of using a hash map for this problem is O(n). Could you explain why this approach is more efficient than the brute force method and how the hash map specifically offers this improvement in terms of operations being performed? \\n\\n(Note: Wait for the candidate's response before proceeding to Question 2.)\", 'summary': \"The candidate explained that by leveraging the properties of a hash map for lookups (which is constant time O(1)), we avoid having to search through the array multiple times (which would have been an O(n) operation for each element, resulting in O(nÂ²) for the whole process in the brute-force method). This explanation demonstrates a understanding of both the problem and the data structures involved (hash map), indicating a sufficient depth in algorithmic knowledge and reasoning. \\n\\n**Question 2:**  \\nYou briefly mentioned the use of 'complement' to find the required element in the hash map. Could you elaborate more on this concept and explain why this approach significantly reduces the number of operations? \\n\\n(Note: The candidate's response will help determine how well they understand the crucial part of their solution and their ability to articulate this knowledge.)\"}\n"
